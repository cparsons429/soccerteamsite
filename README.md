# soccerteamsite
A simple project using NextJS, React, Redux, Axios, ImmutableJS, and Bootstrap to create a soccer team website. Functional files are written in TypeScript; design files are written in SCSS.

Install dependencies using Dockerâ€”note there are a large number of third-party wrappers and dependencies required to make these core frameworks work together. Run this repo using NodeJS.

The nomenclature, coding style, and organizational patterns modeled in this repo should be seen as standards for my code from now on.
