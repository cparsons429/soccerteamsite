(1) You must accept the following terms and conditions for your present and future contributions to this repository.

(2) "You" or "Your" shall mean the individual or legal entity with Contributor access. For legal entities, the entity making a contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

(3) "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Colin Parsons for inclusion in, or documentation of, anything owned or managed by Colin Parsons (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Colin Parsons or his representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, communication technologies such as Slack, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Colin Parsons.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this license for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

(6) You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Colin Parsons, or that your employer has executed a separate Contributor License Agreement with Colin Parsons.

You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which You are aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

(8) Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Colin Parsons separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are aware, and conspicuously marking the work "Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]".
